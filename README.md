# AI-Notes

## LLMS
**Summary:** LLMs, or Large Language Models, are advanced AI models trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like language. They are used in various applications such as natural language processing, machine translation, and conversational agents.

## RAG
**Summary:** RAG, or Retrieval-Augmented Generation, is a technique that combines information retrieval with language generation. It enhances the performance of language models by retrieving relevant information from external sources to improve the quality and accuracy of generated text.

## Framework
**Summary:** Frameworks provide structured environments and tools to develop, train, and deploy AI models efficiently. They streamline the process and offer pre-built components to speed up development.

### Langchain
**Summary:** Langchain is a framework designed for building applications using large language models. It provides tools and abstractions to integrate LLMs into various workflows and applications seamlessly.

#### Langsmith
**Summary:** Langsmith is a component within the Langchain framework, offering specialized tools and functionalities to enhance the development and deployment of language model-based applications.

## OpenAI
**Summary:** OpenAI is an AI research lab and company known for developing advanced AI models such as GPT-3. They focus on creating AI technologies that are safe, beneficial, and widely accessible, and provide various AI services and APIs for developers and businesses.
